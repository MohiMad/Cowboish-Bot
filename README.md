Cowboish Bot allows you to interact with the Identity V community in every possible way through Discord.
The bot is open source in hope of someone finding use of it's code. I'm not a professional developer so my code isn't the best, don't rely on it too much lol. You can find a lot of in-game screenshots in the code, they aren't mine so using them is up to you ^-^
