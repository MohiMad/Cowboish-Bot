        Dear player:
        Welcome to Identity V!
        Identity V will undergo maintenance at 08:00 on December 10, 2020 (UTC+S) and will take
        approximately 240 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to
        servers. We ask for your understanding and patience during maintenance.
        Maintenance content for this week:

        **Battle Adjustments**
        
        "Herald" Adjustments:
        - Tier 0 Ability [Swoop!] Adjustment:
        Added a new effect for tapping the ability the third time: Tapping for the third time enables the
        Cat to expand the Paralysis Area and intimidate Survivors caught within. Intimidated Survivors
        won't be able to decode, heal, or use items for 10 seconds. The Cat will return to the shadows after
        the ability is cast, and the ability will enter cooldown.
        
        - Tier 0 Ability [Catwalk] Adjustment:
        This ability is now rechargeable and can be recovered once every 16 seconds. In the process of
        Dash Hit. the Dlauer may slightly adjust the direction by turning the camera.
        
        This ability will now increase the maximum rechargeable limit of Catwalk to 2.
        Stat Adjustments:
        
        - Cat's outline is now visible within 40 meters instead of unlimited range.
        New Mechanics:

        - When a Survivor is using "Euphoria, " a notification prompt will appear on their portrait, which
        is only visible to Survivors (In Tarot mode, it is visible to players in the same faction).
