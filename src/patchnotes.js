        Maintenance content for this week:

[Event]
Once upon a time, a king wished to pass a new law strongly opposed by his subjects. The displeased citizens conjured a plot to infect the palace with a "cat malady" in an attempt to disfigure the king's face into that of a cat.
When the prime minister learned of the plot, he told the king that, as long as he collected a variety of certain fish and boiled them into a bowl of fish soup, he would be immune to the cat malady.
And so the king offered a reward to any champion who could make this special fish soup for him and save him from the cat malady.
