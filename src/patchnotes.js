Update Notice [March 4, 2021]


Identity V will be updated on March 4, 2021 (UTC+8). The following content is for reference only, and the content of the actual maintenance notice shall prevail.
- Rank Point Adjustments: Added points for Defeat/Draw Protection in Tier IV Rank Matches and slightly increased the points for Defeat Protection in Tier III Rank Matches. Added compensatory points for defeats and draws when Cipher Machine Decoding reached certain progression, Hunter containment reached a certain duration, and saving others without injury for a certain number of times. Added compensatory points for players when another player in the team was AFK, but the player who teamed up with such player wouldn't get the points.
Thank you for your continued support for Identity V. We will attach gifts via in-game mail to compensate for any inconvenience that the maintenance may cause!`
