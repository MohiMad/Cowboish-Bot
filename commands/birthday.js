The full story can be found on our [Cowboish Community](https://discord.com/invite/YWcSukS)**\n\nSo yep! On 11/10/2019 the idea of creating Cowboish came to my mind. I did my researches yk, looked it up on google, YouTube and watched some tutorials, the thing is that creating a bot required a better device than the one I had at that time so I um- yes, I stole my mom's laptop when we had a guest at home :v\nSo I opened up YouTube and searched up:\n["How to make your own Disocrd Bot"](https://youtu.be/X_qg0Ut9nU8)\n*Btw the hyperlink above leads to the exact tutorial series I used to make Cowboish :3*\n\nFrom there I started off making a complete basic (say "yee") bot responds with ("haw") command... I kept using mom's laptop for 3 months or so until I asked for my own. What I'm tryna point is that everything can be possibly done as long as you have the will and patience for it :)\n\nYou have been given:\n**LIMITED Cowboish 1st year anniversary frame ðŸŽ‰**\n**6000**<:clue:655384523735040000>, **25**<:ess1:655840713904488469> and **16000**<:frags:655840344725913600>\n\nYou can equip the frame by doing\n` + "`" + prefix + "equip frame anniversary`\n\nWanna check what skins you can buy with fragments <:frags:655840344725913600>?
