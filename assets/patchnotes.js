About Chasing Shadows

A. Backstory


Those who are lost in their nightmares will be captured by Yidhra and sent into a dream she

constructed—a bizarre racecourse. She will select an agile, lucky, and capable champion to become
the missionary on her behalf. The losers will stay in this dream and receive eternal torture by
Yidhra's Followers.


B. Introduction

1, Gameplay: (Chasing Shadows] consists of 6 players who are tasked with clearing the Dream
Witch's racecourse and reaching the Exit Gate at the finish line.

2. Map Route: In the dream constructed by the Dream Witch, players must proceed along a set
route and go through the racecourse twice. Once the first player gets to the finish line, there will
be a 20-second countdown before the race comes to an end.

3. Point Rules: The 6 players will either complete the race solo or in a team. For [Solo Mode},
players will be ranked according to their finishing time. For (Team Mode], players will form
teams of two and teams will be ranked based on the total ranking points gained by the two
players in a team. The first place player will receive bonus points if they win by 10 seconds or
more.

4. Character Limitations: All Survivor characters can participate in the races, but they can't
carry any items. All characters' Movement Speed and Interaction Speed will also be balanced.

C. About the Items

1. There are item spawn points on the map. Players can touch them to obtain a random item.
Once an item spawn point has been touched and refreshed, each subsequent refreshing will have
longer intervals.

2. The random items available include Elbow Pads, Flare Guns, Lassoes, Magnets, Smoke Bottles,
Mud Bottles, Shields, etc. Utilize these items to disrupt other players or clear the stages quickly.

3. Each player has 2 item slots. Lf the player obtains a new item when both of the 2 slots are filled,
the item obtained the earliest will be replaced by default.

D. About the Stages

1. The terrain of the racecourse has been altered by the Dream Witch to include traps such as
moving walls, spinning walls, repulsion pallets, trampolines, etc. Players must adapt to these
traps in order to win.

2. Other Hunters may also appear and attack players in each race! Rumor has it that the "Ripper
“and the Feaster is making an appearance on the first week. Watch out for their fast-moving
Fog Blades and sneaky Tentacles!

E. Detail Adjustments

The abilities of characters and items in this mode are adjusted by the Dream Witch. The types
items available and details of their adjustments are as follows:

1, Elbow Pads; Gain a directional acceleration by touching the wall. Usage: 1.
2. Lasso: Can be used by all characters. Usage: 1.
3. Magnet: Two Magnets with the same polarity can be thrown out at the same time. Usage: 1.

4. Flare Gun: One shot will be fired at the frontrunner by default. The frontrunner will be
stunned for 3 seconds upon being hit. Effective only against non-teammates in team races.

5. Shield: Use it to block incoming damage or directional ability once. The Shield will be effective
for 5 seconds.

6. Smoke Bottle: Emits a smokescreen to obstruct other players’ view.

7. Mud Bottle: Once it is thrown, it will shatter and leave a huge area of mud on the ground. The
movement speed of players who walk on the mud will be significantly reduced.

8. Rugby Ball: Its duration is adjusted as 2 seconds.

9. When the sixth place player is too far behind the next player, they will gain a 10 second speed
boost (this boost has a 20-second cooldown). Try to catch up!
