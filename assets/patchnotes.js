Update Notice [February 23, 2021]
Identity V will be updated on February 23, 2021 (UTC+8). The following content is for reference only, and the content of the actual maintenance notice shall prevail.
- Season 15 has officially begun. All new Logic Path rewards, EXP level rewards, Deduction Quests, Memory Spheres, and Rank Treasures are now available.
- In Season 15, Rank Match Tiers will be carried over to the next season according to the player's tier in the previous season, and corresponding rewards will be awarded.
- In Season 15, the maximum capacity of 4-Sided Dice will be 100. Players will be unable to retain more than 100 4-Sided Dices, so please use them at your earliest convenience.
- Rank Point Adjustments: Added points for Defeat/Draw Protection in Tier IV Rank Matches and slightly increased the points for Defeat Protection in Tier III Rank Matches. Added compensatory points for defeats and draws where Cipher Machine Decoding reached certain progression, Hunter containment reached a certain duration, and saving others without injury for a certain number of times. Added compensatory points for players when another player in the team was AFK, but the player who teamed up with such player wouldn't get the points.
- Adjustments to Rank Match Team-up Rules: Once a Survivor player reaches Tier VI, they can only team up with players who are within 5 Sub-tiers. For players who are Tier VII or above, every 5 stars will be regarded as a Sub-tier.
- The evening Rank Matches timeslot for players who are below Tier V (excluding Tier V) is adjusted from 19:00-21:00 to 18:00-22:00. The timeslot for players who are Tier V or above remains the same at 19:00-21:00.
- The time-limited "Chasing Shadows" mode will be temporarily unavailable. In the meantime, we will work on improving the problems and shortcomings in this gameplay. Please stay tuned for more Hunters joining later on!
Thank you for your continued support for Identity V. We will attach gifts via in-game mail to compensate for any inconvenience that the maintenance may cause!`
