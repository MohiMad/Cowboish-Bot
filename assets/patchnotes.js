        Welcome to Identity V!

Identity V will undergo maintenance at 08:00 on January 21, 2021 (UTC+8) and will take
approximately 240 minutes to complete. During this time, players will be unable to log in to
servers, We ask for your understanding and patience during maintenance.

Maintenance content for this week:
Call of the Abyss:

- [Abyss Treasure]: New Abyss Treasure has arrived along with a brand new lineup of costumes,
including S Costume "Gamekeeper - Molten Hound", A Costumes "Prospector - Highway Cavalier",
 "Barmaid - Fueling Agent,” "Priestess - Reflective Mirror", and "Acrobat - Pumping Tires."
Players will not obtain duplicate A Costumes until all A Costumes have been obtained.


**Event**

- Character Day: Hastur's (Feaster) Character Day (January 24) is coming up along with the
annual Hastur's Character Day Event! Participate in the event and complete Quests to get
unique Character rewards!

For Hastur's second Character Day in Identity V, we've prepared various new rewards to celebrate
this milestone! Players who have obtained the portrait from his first Character Day event will
receive a second-year Character Day Portrait Frame after completing the event quests! Those who
haven't obtained the reward from Hastur's first Character Day event will receive his first-year
Character Day reward.


Event Period: January 24, 00:00;00 - January 24, 23:59:59 (Server Time)

**Battle**

- Once a Survivor who's tied to a balloon stopped struggling for 3 seconds, their struggle progress
will increase by 3% per second (i.e., 50% of the normal struggling speed). This mechanism won't
trigger any struggling movement, and it will halt when the Survivor begins to struggle and reset
when they stop. However, this doesn't apply to a Survivor's Mirror Image captured by the
Photographer in the Camera World.

- Added the Batter's Cricket Hit Aim-Assist in Settings, which is turned off by default. Once
it's turned on, the Batter will target the nearest Hunter when he uses the Cricket Bat.

- The Batter can now see the outline of fallen Cricket Balls nearby.

- The Mechanic's Doll will now be stunned when hit by the tram in Eversleeping Town.

- The Postman won't receive the Bravery Letter and the Hope Letter at the beginning of a battle.
- After exceeding a certain period of time for the Postman's Post Dog to deliver a letter, the Post
Dog will appear in proximity to the recipient and deliver the letter directly if the recipient is
available to accept delivery.

**Shop**

~ The Spyglass Package is available for a limited time at the cost of 288 Echoes. It contains 100
Spyglasses, 188 Clues, and 188 Fragments.

Availability: January 21, 2021 (after maintenance) - February 17, 2021, 23:59:59 (Server Time)

**Experience Improvements**

- Added pages available for the emotes/graffiti Wheel. Players will have to manually activate
the second page at the Display Interface, which will give them 12 slots in the emotes/graffiti
Wheel.

- Improved the displaying rules of the emotes/graffiti Wheel so that players won't have to wait
until the end of an emote before switching to another slot in the Wheel.

Rank Matches.

- If the matching failed due to unforeseeable circumstances (not being ready, reconnecting after
disconnecting, losing connection, etc.), your waiting time will continue from the previous interruption if you restart matching within 1 minute.

When Axe Boy uses a Resentful Soul to hit any target other than himself, feedback will be
triggered from the hit on mobile devices.
  

- Added an introduction of the Synesthesia Mode in the Detective's costume selection interface.
